The object is called a projectile, and its path is called its trajectory. The motion involves two independent components: horizontal motion with constant velocity and vertical motion with constant acceleration caused by gravity. Despite these simple conditions, the motion of a projectile remains a classic example of physics in action.\r\n    </p>\r\n   \r\n   \r\n    <script type=\"module\" src=\"/0364f57fbff2fabbe941ed20c328ef1a.js\"></script>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"d5000e588b31196e09985dbe794b1e72","cacheData":{}}
