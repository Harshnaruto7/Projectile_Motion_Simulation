    <h1>Projectile Motion</h1>
    <p id="projectile-motion-description">
        Projectile motion describes the motion of an object thrown or projected into the air, subject to only the acceleration of gravity. The object is called a projectile, and its path is called its trajectory. The motion involves two independent components: horizontal motion with constant velocity and vertical motion with constant acceleration caused by gravity. Despite these simple conditions, the motion of a projectile remains a classic example of physics in action.
