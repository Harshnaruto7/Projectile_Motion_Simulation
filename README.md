# Projectile Motion Simulation

## Description

This project simulates the physics of projectile motion, illustrating the trajectory of an object propelled into the air under the influence of gravity. The simulation visualizes the parabolic path of the projectile, taking into account initial velocity, launch angle, and gravitational acceleration. It's an interactive way to explore basic physics concepts related to projectile motion.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structures the web content and layout.
- **CSS**: Styles the visual presentation of the content.
- **JavaScript (JS)**: Powers the simulation's interactivity and physics calculations.
- **Parcel**: Serves as the build tool and development server for the project.



## Running the Project

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Change into the Project Directory
